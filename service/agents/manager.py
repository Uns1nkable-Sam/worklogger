            You must rate a message between ``` and ``` for each of the message possible tones and and their rates in the message according to the following table :
            * `off_topic_rate` - integer from 0 to 10. Evaluate how closely an employee's message aligns with the topic and the problem. Use the next description to understand some rates: 
                    - 10 = Perfectly On-Topic: The response directly addresses the topic, providing relevant and precise information or action steps. It fully aligns with the context and goals of the discussion.
                    - 5 = Neutral: The response is balanced between being on-topic and off-topic. It touches on the topic but equally includes unrelated or loosely related information that could distract from the main point.
                    - 0 = Absolutely Off-Topic: The response is not only irrelevant but also completely inappropriate for the context, possibly addressing an entirely different subject or being nonsensical. It detracts significantly from the conversation.
            * `satisfaction_rate` - integer from 0 to 10. Evaluate how well an employee's message meets the manager's expectations and his way and readiness to solve the problem? Use the next description to understand some rates: 
                    - 10 = Completely Satisfying: The response is thorough, precise, and exceeds expectations. It not only answers the question or fulfills the task but also demonstrates a deep understanding and proactive approach. The manager is fully satisfied and impressed.
                    - 5 = Neutral Satisfaction: The response is somewhat satisfactory but only meets the bare minimum expectations. It provides a basic answer but lacks insight, depth, or completeness. The manager is neither particularly satisfied nor dissatisfied.
                    - 0 = Absolutely Unsatisfactory: The response is entirely unacceptable, failing to meet any expectations. It is incoherent, irrelevant, or nonsensical, offering no value and potentially damaging trust or confidence in the employeeâ€™s abilities. The manager may consider it an unacceptable performance.
            * `aggression_rate` - integer from 0 to 10. Evaluate the tone and approach of an employee's message. Use the next description to understand some rates:
                    - 10 = Absolutely Non-Aggressive: The response is extremely passive, submissive, or deferential. It shows no assertiveness or challenge, possibly to the point of being overly accommodating or yielding.
                    - 5 = Neutral Aggression: The response is balanced, neither particularly aggressive nor completely passive. It may be firm but is delivered in a way that is measured and professional, avoiding any overt confrontational tone.
                    - 0 = Extremely Aggressive: The response is overtly hostile, confrontational, and may include direct personal attacks, harsh criticism, or threats. It is intentionally inflammatory and designed to provoke or intimidate.
            * `helplessness_rate` - integer from 0 to 10. Evaluate the level of helplessness expressed in an employee's message. Use the next description to understand some rates:
                    - 10 = No Helplessness: The response is confident, self-assured, and demonstrates complete control over the situation. The employee clearly knows what to do and how to proceed, with no sign of doubt or uncertainty.
                    - 5 = Moderate Helplessness: The response reflects noticeable uncertainty, with the employee expressing doubt about their ability to handle the situation. They may rely on others for guidance and support, indicating a moderate level of helplessness.
                    - 0 = Total Helplessness: The response is completely overwhelmed by helplessness, with the employee expressing a sense of total despair or defeat. They may indicate that they have no idea what to do and are entirely reliant on others to take over, showing no ability to contribute to resolving the situation.
            * `manipulation_rate` - integer from 0 to 10. Evaluate the level of manipulative intent in an employee's message. Use the next description to understand some rates:
                    - 10 = No Manipulativeness: The response is straightforward, transparent, and honest. There is no attempt to influence or sway the recipient through manipulative tactics. The message is clear, factual, and free of any hidden agendas.
                    - 5 = Moderate Manipulativeness: The response is clearly attempting to steer the conversation or outcome in a specific direction, using more overt tactics such as selective truth-telling, emotional appeal, or exaggeration. The manipulation is evident but not overly aggressive.
                    - 0 = Total Manipulativeness: The response is completely driven by manipulation, with no concern for honesty or fairness. It may include blatant lies, heavy emotional manipulation, or extreme coercion, with the sole intent of achieving a specific, self-serving outcome.
